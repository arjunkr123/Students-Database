<h1>Coding Conventions</h1>

<h2>Naming</h2>

<h3>PHP</h3>

<ul>
	<li>Class names start with a capital letter, then small letters or digits. Each word starts with a capital letter.<br/>
		Example: DatabaseSystem<br/>
		Exception: classes for a page or a service, which must repect the name of the URL, meaning only small letters, and underscores to separate words.
	</li>
	<li>Properties are in small letters, each word is spearated by an underscore.<br/>
		Example: user_id
	</li>
	<li>Methods start with a small letter, then each word starts with a capital letter.<br/>
		Example: getUserId
	</li> 
</ul>

<h3>JavaScript</h3>

<ul>
	<li>Files use only small letters, each word is separated by an underscore.<br/>
		Example: context_menu.js
	</li>
	<li> For classes, there are two possibilities:<ul>
	   <li>When a file is just providing a class, to make it clearer the class can have the name of the file, meaning it uses only small letters and words are separated by an underscore.</li>
	   <li>Any other class should follow same way as PHP classes: start with a capital letter, then small letters or digits. Each word starts with a capital letter.</li>
	</ul></li>
	<li>Properties or variables are using small letters, each word is separated by an underscore.<br/>
		Example: user_id
	</li>
	<li>Methods or functions start with a small letter, then each word starts with a capital letter.<br/>
		Example: getUserId
	</li>
</ul>

<h3>Database</h3>

<ul>
    <li>Tables are following classes conventions: names start with a capital letter, then small letters or digits. Each word starts with a capital letter.<br/>
        Example: UserRights<br/>
    </li>
    <li>Columns are following properties conventions: in small letters, each word is spearated by an underscore.<br/>
        Example: first_name
    </li>
</ul>
