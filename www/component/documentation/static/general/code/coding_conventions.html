<h2>Naming</h2>

<h3>PHP</h3>

<ul>
	<li>Class names start with a capital letter, then small letters or digits. Each word starts with a capital letter.<br/>
		Example: DatabaseSystem<br/>
		Exception: classes for a page or a service, which must repect the name of the URL, meaning only small letters, and underscores to separate words.
	</li>
	<li>Properties are in small letters, each word is spearated by an underscore.<br/>
		Example: user_id
	</li>
	<li>Methods start with a small letter, then each word starts with a capital letter.<br/>
		Example: getUserId
	</li> 
</ul>

<h3>JavaScript</h3>

	<li>Files use only small letters, each word is separated by an underscore.<br/>
		Example: context_menu.js
	</li>
	<li>Classes are following the same convention as the file names, as usually a file contains a single class</li>
